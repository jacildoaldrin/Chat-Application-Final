Notes:
 - For the login, only used basic routing that checks if username + password exist in the database.
 - Sort works for the event and message history, just click the header of whichever column you want to sort with.
 - And lastly, for the demo of the app, just click that frontend link, otherwise, install dependencies for each folder(frontend, backend).
